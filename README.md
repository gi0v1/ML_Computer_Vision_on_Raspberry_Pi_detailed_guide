# ML-Computer-Vision-on-Raspberry-Pi---step-by-step-guide
Step-by-step guide to build and deploy a ML object detection (and later object tracking) model on a Raspberry Pi

This guide is inteded to explain how to train a ML (Machine Learning) model, in my case an object detection model, and deploy it to a Raspberry Pi.
I'm writing this as I'm I doing (and learning) the process myself, therefore I hope to help other people who want to make my same thing to save some time.

## PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS STILL WORK-IN-PROGRESS
If you have any suggestions, think that something is wrong, ecc. please let me now.
