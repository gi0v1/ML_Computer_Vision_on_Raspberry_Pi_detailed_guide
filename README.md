# ML_Computer_Vision_on_Raspberry_Pi_guide
### Step-by-step guide implement ML object detection (and later object tracking) on a Raspberry Pi

# INTRO
## BACKGROUND
I've been part of a RoboCup (Rescue Line) team and among my task was the development of a software which had to identify and track some balls, so that the robot could pick them.
In this guide I'll try to explain my journey and to cover how to train a TensorFlow Lite ML model with your own dataset and then deploy it on a Raspberry Pi.
<br/>
## REPOS
In this guide I'm trying to organize the code from the following repositories:
- https://github.com/gpego/robot1
- https://github.com/gpego/tflite
- https://github.com/gpego/arduino-serial-com
- https://github.com/gpego/Python-serial-com
- https://github.com/gpego/newCode

They're quite messy üòÖ, that's why I'm trying to put all toghether in this guide.
<br/>
## DISCLAIMER
I'm not by any mean an expert in this field therefore there might be some errors in the following instructions and I would like to apologize in advance. Anyway I'll write only after having had things working so following the guide you should be able to have something working. I'm not a native English speaker either so there may be some errors on that side too.
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG, ECC. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

# SETUP
## HARDWARE
To deploy a TFLite model on a Raspberry Pi you'll need... You guessed it, a Raspberry Pi!
The project started with a Pi 4, then mid-development the Pi 5 came out. Below there's a small description about the Pis I've used:
- Pi 3B+: if you have one laying around it's technically usable to get started but don't expect it to perform real-time object detection
- Pi 4: started with that, if you already have one it's ok (I've tried the 2GB and 4GB), in real-time applications I was able to get ~10fps
- Pi 5 (üëë): if you have to buy a Pi, buy this one (I've got the 8GB but the 4GB should be absolutely fine), definitely worth it. Works well in real time and it's also nicer during the development process

If you want to perform real-time object detection, you'll likely need a camera, I would recomend the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (Wide if you need) for image quality and ease of use.
<br/>
Of course you'll need to power your Pi, the recomended way to do that is throught the official power supply but you can use a battery as well.
<br/>
ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏è: if you choose the latter be careful to provide the Pi with the correct voltage (the PS outputs 5.1V but 5.0V are OK). Small variations may well kill the Pi, I mistakenly provided one with 5.95V, it is now hanged on a wall as a ornament.
<br/>
## RASPBERRY PI CONFIGURATION
First of all you'll have to flash the OS onto your microSD card. The [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) is higly recomended, it is the official Debian distro of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
The Pi can be connected to actual peripherals but for this application I found it convenient to use it *headless* which means to connect to the Pi using a client device (your PC), basically what you'd do with AnyDesk or TeamViewer.
To read more about the topic and configure a headless Raspebrry Pi I'd recomend [this article](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html) from Tom's Hardware.
<br/>
## DEVELOPMENT SETUP
Where it is technically possible to do the entire process on the Pi given that it is by all means a PC, I wouldn't recomend it beacuse it can be laggish and unpractical.
<br/>
There are 2 main approaches you can use instead:
- Method #1: code on a PC and deploy on the Pi afterwards
- Method #2: connect the PC to the Pi and code remotely (üëë)

### Method #1
The Pi runs a specific 
Given that Linux is the best choice for this kind of things I would either recommend to use a Linux system or if you use Windows, to install [WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) as I've done following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
