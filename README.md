### Step-by-step guide to build and deploy a ML object detection (and later object tracking) model on a Raspberry Pi

This guide is inteded to explain how to train a ML (Machine Learning) model, in my case an object detection model, and deploy it to a Raspberry Pi.
I'm writing this as I'm learning the process myself and I hope to help other people who want to make something similar to what I'm doing to save some time and avoid some trouble.
This process is useful for a lot of applications such as Robotics, IoT, ecc.
It will be fun! Hopefully :).

## DISCLAIMER
I'm not in any way an expert in this field therefore there might be some errors in the following instructions and I would like to apologize in advance. Anyway I'll write only after having had things working so following the guide you shuold be able to have something working. I'm not a native English speaker either so there may be some errors on that side too.
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG, ECC. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

## PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS STILL WORK-IN-PROGRESS

# SETUP
## HARDWARE
First of all we need to set up our PC and our Raspberry Pi. I'm using a Windows laptop, Linux would be even better, I've never used macOS and I don't know what might be different anyway the OS will be covered later. As I'm writing I'm using a Pi 3B+ and while it can work, something more powerful, like a Pi 4, is definitely recommnded (I'm waiting for a Pi 5 to ship).
